Eloquently is a recruiting firm. We also host workshops that teach web development and career skills. If you are looking for a job or are interested in joining our web development workshops, please [contact us](/index#contact)!

We put together some [guides](/guides/index) for participants in our workshops. Feel free to use them. If you see any errors, please submit an issue on our [github repository](https://github.com/eloquently/eloquently.github.io).

These guides are a work in progress. If you see any errors or have a suggestion for a better way to do something, please [let us know](/index#contact).
