## React Blackjack Part 3

<hr />

This is the third part of the guide. See the previous part [here]({% post_url 2016-05-19-react-blackjack-part-2 %}). At this point, our application has some basic functionality. We can deal cards to the player with by clicking "Deal" and disable the buttons by clicking "Stand", but it's still a stretch to call this a blackjack game.

Let's fix that.

### Winning and Losing

In our blackjack game, the player should not be allowed to take cards indefinitely. Instead, they should lose the game if they draw a card and their score is higher than 21.

How can we change our code to accommodate this rule? The `reducer` function is the natural place for logic like this, as it is responsible for determining the next state of the application given the current state and an action.

Before we change our reducer logic, let's first write a function that will take a `List` of cards and return their score as a blackjack hand.

We'll first need to write a test for this. We'll add this function to our `cards.js` file, so the test will be in `cards_spec.js`

<div class="fp">test/lib/cards_spec.js</div>
```js
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { List<mark>, fromJS</mark> } from 'immutable';

import { newDeck, deal<mark>, score</mark> } from '../../app/lib/cards';

describe('cards.js', () => {
    // ...

    describe('score()', () => {
        it('calculates correct score', () => {
            let hand = fromJS([{rank: 3}, {rank: 5}]);
            expect(score(hand)).to.eq(8);
            hand = fromJS([{rank: 2}, {rank: 9}]);
            expect(score(hand)).to.eq(11);
        });
    });
});
```

Let's write the code to make this pass. We are going to use the `reduce` function to caclulate the sum. In this case, `reduce()` will take two parameters: a function, which we'll describe in a second, and an initial value.

The first parameter function (let's call it `f`) itself takes two parameters. `reduce()` works by, for each element of the array, passing the result of the last `f` call (or the initial value for the first one) to `f` along with the current element. Then it evaluates `f` for those parameters, and passes the result `f` along with the next element.

In this case, we want to add each card's rank, and we'll keep track of the result in a variable called `sum`:

<div class="fp">app/lib/cards.js</div>
```js
// ...

export const score = (cards) => {
    return cards.reduce( (sum, card) => {
        return sum + card.get('rank');
    }, 0);
};
```

Now the tests should pass, but our function will only work in a very limited case: when the ranks are numbers.

Let's write the tests for when the ranks are face cards:

<div class="fp">test/lib/cards_spec.js</div>
```js{7,14,15-22}
// test/lib/cards_spec.js

describe('cards.js', () => {
    // ...

    describe('score()', () => {
        describe('with numeric ranks', () => {
            it('calculates correct score', () => {
                let hand = fromJS([{rank: 3}, {rank: 5}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(8);
                hand = fromJS([{rank: 2}, {rank: 9}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(11);
            });
        });
        describe('with face cards', () => {
            it('calculates correct score', () => {
                let hand = fromJS([{rank: 3}, {rank: 'K'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(13);
                hand = fromJS([{rank: 'Q'}, {rank: 'J'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(20);
            });
        });
    });
});
```

To pass the test, we will have to tell our program to count kings, queens, and jacks as 10 points. We'll write a helper method called `rankAsNum` to do that for us.

<div class="fp">app/lib/cards.js</div>
```js
// ...

export const rankAsNum = (rank) => {
    if(rank == 'K' || rank == 'Q' || rank == 'J') {
        return 10;
    } else {
        return rank;
    }
};

export const score = (cards) => {
    return cards.reduce( (sum, card) => {
        return sum + <mark>/* What goes here? */</mark>;
    }, 0);
};
```

Once you get the test to pass, the next step is to consider is what happens with aces. In blackjack, the ace can be worth either 1 point or 11 points. For this application, we want the ace to count as 11 unless total of the hand is greater than 21.

Let's clarify what we want with some test cases:

<div class="fp">test/lib/cards_spec.js</div>
```js
import { <mark>Map, </mark>List, fromJS } from 'immutable';

describe('cards.js', () => {
    // ...

    describe('score()', () => {
        // ...

        describe('with aces', () => {
            it('counts aces as 11 for hands less than 21', () => {
                const hand = fromJS([{rank: 3}, {rank: 'A'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(14);
            });

            it('counts aces as 11 for hands equal to 21', () => {
                let hand = fromJS([{rank: 10}, {rank: 'A'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(21);
                hand = fromJS([{rank: 'A'}, {rank: 'K'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(21);
            });

            it('counts aces as 1 for hands greater than 21', () => {
                let hand = fromJS([{rank: 3}, {rank: 'A'}, {rank: 9}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(13);
                hand = fromJS([{rank: 'K'}, {rank: 'K'}, {rank: 'A'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(21);
            });

            it('works with multiple aces', () => {
                let hand = fromJS([{rank: 'A'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(11);
                hand = hand.push(new Map({rank: 'A'}));
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(12);
                hand = hand.push(new Map({rank: 'A'}));
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(13);
                hand = hand.push(new Map({rank: 'A'}));
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(14);
                hand = fromJS([{rank: 'A'}, {rank: 'K'}, {rank: 'A'}]);
                expect(score(hand)).to.eq(12);
            })
        });
    });
});
```

Modifying the `score` function to pass these tests is a great way to practice for interview questions. Try to pass the tests yourself before looking at our solution below.

If you're getting stuck, here is an English description of how to solve the problem:

- Count how many aces there are in the hand (`acesCount`)
- Calculate the score of the rest of the hand and add 1 for each ace that was removed. Store this in a variable called `score`.
- Add 10 if `score` is less than or equal to 11

Before moving on to the code, think about this and write out by hand a few examples of how this algorithm would be applied (maybe one per each of the four test cases above). Why does this work? Why do we only have to add ten once at the end? Does that part still work if there are multiple aces?

Once you feel like you've figured out how this algorithm works, try to code it yourself before looking at our code.

<div class="fp">app/lib/cards.js</div>
```js
// ...

export const score = (cards) => {
    const aces = cards.filter((card) => card.get('rank') == 'A');
    const nonAces = cards.filter((card) => card.get('rank') != 'A');

    if(nonAces.size == 0 && aces.size == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if(aces.size == 0) {
        return cards.reduce( (sum, card) => {
            return sum + rankAsNum(card.get('rank'));
        }, 0);
    } else {
        let acesAllOneScore = score(nonAces) + aces.size;
        if(acesAllOneScore <= 11) {
            acesAllOneScore += 10;
        }
        return acesAllOneScore;
    }
};
```

Now that we can calculate a score, we can check the player's score after they have received a card. If the score is higher than 21, we should increase the loss count. We will do this in the `reducer` helper function `dealToPlayer()`. Let's write the test first:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js{10-12,24-35}
// ...
import { Map, List<mark>, fromJS</mark> } from 'immutable';

// ...

describe('reducer', () => {
    // ...

    describe("DEAL_TO_PLAYER", () => {
        const action = dealToPlayer();

        const initialState = new Map({"playerHand": new List(), "deck": newDeck()});
        const nextState = reducer(initialState, action);

        it('adds one card to player hand', () => {
            expect(nextState.get('playerHand').size).to.eq(initialState.get('playerHand').size + 1);
        });

        it('removes one card from deck', () => {
            expect(nextState.get('deck').size).to.eq(initialState.get('deck').size - 1);
        });


        describe("when player gets more than 21 points", () => {
            const initialState = fromJS({
                "playerHand": [{rank: 'K'}, {rank: 'Q'}],
                "deck": fromJS([{rank: 'J'}]),
                "lossCount": 0
            });
            const nextState = reducer(initialState, action);

            it('increases loss count by 1', () => {
                expect(nextState.get('lossCount')).to.eq(initialState.get('lossCount') + 1);
            });
        });

    // ...
});
```

In these tests, we cheat a little bit to make the player draw the right card for the scenario we want to test by only putting one card in the deck. Our tests here are not exactly "unit" tests because they have a lot of dependencies on other parts of the program. Specifically, if something goes wrong with the `score` function (or the `draw` function), this test won't work any more. This is not ideal, and we could use stubs from Sinon to make our tests more independent. We will see how this works in a little bit.

And then add some logic to the reducer:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js{12-22}
// ...

import { newDeck, deal<mark>, score</mark> } from './lib/cards';

// ...

const dealToPlayer = (currentState, seed) => {
    const [deck, newCard] = deal(currentState.get('deck'), 1, seed);

    const playerHand = currentState.get('playerHand').push(newCard.get(0));

    let newState = new Map({ deck, playerHand });

    const newScore = score(playerHand);

    if(newScore > 21) {
        const lossCount = currentState.get('lossCount') + 1;
        newState = newState.set('lossCount', lossCount);
    }

    return currentState.merge(newState);
};

// ...
```

Now try playing a game in your browser. Keep clicking "hit" until your score is above 21. You should see your loss count increase. Note that if you continue to click "hit", you continue drawing cards and your loss count continues to rise.

Let's think about what should happen after each game ends. It would be nice to show a message to the player saying whether the game ended with a win or a loss. It would also be nice to show the cards at the end of the game before immediately resetting the game (otherwise the player would never know the last card drawn) and displaying a button the player can click when ready to start the next game.

We'll need a new component for the game over message that will contain a string like "You win!" and a "New Game" button. This component is going to take two props. One will determine whether it should show a win message, loss message, or a draw message. The other will contain the callback function for when the user hits the "New Game" button.

Let's write some tests for the component. First we want to give the component a different message depending on the value of the `win` prop. If `win` is `true` or `false`, we will show a win message or a loss message respectively. If `win` is `undefined`, we will show a "Tie game" message.

<div class="fp">test/components/game_over_message_spec.js</div>
```js
import React from 'react';
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';

import { GameOverMessage } from '../../app/components/game_over_message';

describe('<GameOverMessage />' , () => {
    describe('for win', () => {
        const rendered = shallow(<GameOverMessage win={true} />);

        it('displays message', () => {
            expect(rendered).to.include.text('You win!');
        });
    });

    describe('for loss', () => {
        const rendered = shallow(<GameOverMessage /* What goes here */ />);

        it('displays message', () => {
            expect(rendered).to.include.text('You lose :(');
        });
    });

    describe('for draw', () => {
        const rendered = shallow(<GameOverMessage win={undefined} />);

        it('displays message', () => {
            expect(rendered).to.include.text('Tie game.');
        });
    });
});
```

Next, we'll write the tests for the button. We'll use a sinon spy again to make sure that the callback prop is executed when the "Next Game" button is clicked.

<div class="fp">test/components/game_over_message_spec.js</div>
```js{3,10-18}
// ...
import { shallow<mark>, simulate</mark> } from 'enzyme';
import sinon from 'sinon';

// ...

describe('<GameOverMessage />' , () => {
    // ...

    describe('next game button', () => {
        it('triggers callback when button is pressed', () => {
            const nextGameSpy = sinon.spy();
            const rendered = shallow(<GameOverMessage nextGame={nextGameSpy} />);

            rendered.find('button').simulate('click');
            expect(nextGameSpy.calledOnce).to.eq(true);
        });
    });
});
```

First we'll get the message tests to pass. One of the limitations of JSX is that you cannot put multi-line JavaScript expresssions (like an `if`-`else`) in the JSX (see [this page](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/if-else-in-JSX.html) for an explanation). So far, we have been getting around this limitation by using ternary statements, but in this case we want an `if - else if - else` statement, so we would have to use nested ternary statements.

The other option is to calcualte the result of the `if - else if - else` outside of the JSX portion and save it in a variable. We'll do that here:

<div class="fp">app/components/game_over_message.js</div>
```js
import React from 'react';

export class GameOverMessage extends React.Component {
    render() {
        let message;

        if(this.props.win === undefined) {
            message = "Tie game.";
        } else if(this.props.win === true) {
            message = "You win!";
        } else {
            message = "You lose :(";
        }

        return (
            <div id="game_over_message">
                { message }
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Next, we need to add a button, and give the button an `onClick` prop:

<div class="fp">app/components/game_over_message.js</div>
```jsx{8}
import React from 'react';

export default class GameOverMessage extends React.Component {
    render() {
        // ...

        return (
            <div id="game_over_message">
                { message }
                <button onClick={this.props.nextGame}>Next Game</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Now all three tests should pass. Next, we need to have the `App` comopnent render the message when the game is over. To determine if the game is over, we will need another state variable: `gameOver`. Since we also will need to know if the player won or lost in order to display the correct message, we will need another state variable: `playerWon`. Both of these variables will be booleans.

At the start of the game and each time the game is reset, we'll want `gameOver` to be `false`. The best way to initialize this variable is to do so in the `SETUP_GAME` action that is called at the start of the application and each time the game needs to be reset. We'll also want to initialize `playerWon` to `undefined` when we `SETUP_GAME`. `playerWon` only needs a value if `gameOver` is `true`.

Let's add a test for this in the `SETUP_GAME` action's reducer test:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js{10-16}
// ...

describe('reducer', () => {
    describe("SETUP_GAME", () => {
        const action = setupGame();

        describe("with empty initial state", () => {
            // ...

            it('sets up gameOver', () => {
                expect(nextState.get('gameOver')).to.eq(false);
            });

            it('sets up playerWon', () => {
                expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(undefined);
            });
        });

        describe("with existing initial state", () => {
            // ...

            it('adds new variables', () => {
                expect(Array.from(nextState.keys())).to.include(
                    'deck', 'playerHand', 'dealerHand',
                    'hasStood'<mark>, 'gameOver', 'playerWon'</mark>
                );
            });

            // ...
        });
    });

    // ...
});
```

We'll need to add a few lines to the `reducer.js` file to initialize these variables:

<div class="fp"></div>
```js{12,13}
const setupGame = (currentState, seed) => {
    let deck = newDeck(seed);
    let playerHand, dealerHand;

    [deck, playerHand] = deal(deck, 2, seed);
    [deck, dealerHand] = deal(deck, 1, seed + 1);

    dealerHand = dealerHand.push(new Map());

    const hasStood = false;

    const gameOver = false;
    const playerWon = undefined;

    const newState = new Map({
        deck, playerHand,
        dealerHand, hasStood,
        <mark>gameOver, playerWon</mark>
    });

    return currentState.merge(newState);
};
```

The tests should now pass. Now, we change our App component to render the message when appropriate. First the tests:

<div class="fp">test/components/app_spec.js</div>
```jsx
// test/components/app_spec.js

// ...

describe('<App />', () => {
    // ...

    describe('when gameOver', () => {
        const rendered = shallow(<App gameOver={true} />);

        it('renders <GameOverMessage />', () => {
            expect(rendered.find('GameOverMessage')).to.have.length(1);
        });

        describe('player won', () => {
            const rendered = shallow(<App gameOver={true} playerWon={true} />);
            it('gives <GameOverMessage /> correct prop', () => {
                expect(rendered.find('GameOverMessage')).to.have.prop('win', true);
            });
        });

        describe('player lost', () => {
            const rendered = shallow(<App gameOver={true} playerWon={false} />);
            it('gives <GameOverMessage /> correct prop', () => {
                expect(rendered.find('GameOverMessage')).to.have.prop('win', false);
            });
        });
    });
});
```

Now let's add the message to our App component.

<div class="fp">app/components/app.js</div>
```jsx{2,6-9,15}
// ...
import { GameOverMessage } from './game_over_message';

export class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        let messageComponent;
        if(this.props.gameOver) {
            messageComponent = <GameOverMessage win={this.props.playerWon} />;
        }

        return (
            <div className="app">
                <h1>React Blackjack</h1>
                <InfoContainer />
                { messageComponent }
                <strong>Player hand:</strong>
                <Hand cards={this.props.playerHand } />
                <strong>Dealer hand:</strong>
                <Hand cards={this.props.dealerHand } />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// ...
```


If `gameOver` is false, the `messageComponent` will be undefined. When we try to render `undefined`, React will just output nothing, which is what we want in this case.

Let's also change the `mapStateToProps` function so that the connected `App` will update when the reducer changes `gameOver` and `playerWon`.

<div class="fp">app/components/app.js</div>
```js
// ...
function mapStateToProps(state) {
    return {
        playerHand: state.get('playerHand'),
        dealerHand: state.get('dealerHand'),
        gameOver: state.get('gameOver'),
        playerWon: state.get('playerWon')
    };
}
```

Now, we need to make the reducer for `DEAL_TO_PLAYER` use the `gameOver` and `playerWon` variables to tell the `App` component to show the message. Let's add these requirements to the tests:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js
// ...

describe('reducer', () => {
    // ...

    describe("DEAL_TO_PLAYER", () => {
        // ...

        describe("when player gets more than 21 points", () => {
            // ...

            it('toggles gameOver and sets playerWon', () => {
                expect(nextState.get('gameOver')).to.eq(true);
                expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(false);
            });
        });

        describe("when player gets exactly 21 points", () => {
            // ...

            it('toggles gameOver and sets playerWon', () => {
                expect(nextState.get('gameOver')).to.eq(true);
                expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(true);
            });
        });
    });

    // ...
});
```

Now let's change the reducer function so that these tests pass:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js{7-10,12}
// ...

const dealToPlayer = (currentState, seed) => {
    // ...

    if(newScore > 21) {
        const lossCount = currentState.get('lossCount') + 1;
        const gameOver = true;
        const playerWon = false;
        newState = newState.merge({lossCount, gameOver, playerWon});
    }

    return currentState.merge(newState);
};

// ...
```

Now try playing a game in the browser. The correct message should be shown when you go over 21. The message is a little hard to see, so we should clean it up with some CSS:

Create a `game_over_message.scss` file in your `app/css/components`, and then import in `components/_all.scss`:

<div class="fp">app/css/components/_all.scss</div>
```scss
@import 'card';
@import 'info';
@import 'game_over_message';
```

Then you can add my style for `#game_over_message` or modify it to look nicer.

<div class="fp">app/css/components/game_over_message.scss</div>
```scss
#game_over_message {
    border: 1px solid #999;
    width: 300px;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;

    button {
        float: right;
    }
}
```

For extra practice with React components, try to give `<GameOverMessage />` a different CSS class so the message can look different depending on whether the player won or lost.

Now that everything is looking nice, let's make that "Next Game" button do something when clicked. To do this, we'll create a `mapDispatchToProps` function on the `GameOverMessage` component and create a connected version of the component:

<div class="fp">app/components/game_over_message.js</div>
```js{2-3,9-15}
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { setupGame } from '../action_creators';

export class GameOverMessage extends React.Component {
    // ...
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    return {
        nextGame: () => dispatch(setupGame())
    };
}

export const GameOverMessageContainer = connect(undefined, mapDispatchToProps)(GameOverMessage);
```

Now we want `App` to render the connected `GameOverMessageContainer` component rather than the "dumb" `GameOverMessage` component. Let's change the tests first.

<div class="fp">test/components/app_spec.js</div>
```jsx
// ...

describe('<App />', () => {
    // ...

    describe('when gameOver', () => {
        const rendered = shallow(<App gameOver={true} />);

        it('renders <GameOverMessage<mark>Container</mark> />', () => {
            expect(rendered.find('<mark>Connect(GameOverMessage)</mark>')).to.have.length(1);
        });

        describe('player won', () => {
            const rendered = shallow(<App gameOver={true} playerWon={true} />);
            it('gives <GameOverMessage<mark>Container</mark> /> correct prop', () => {
                expect(rendered.find('<mark>Connect(GameOverMessage)</mark>')).to.have.prop('win', true);
            });
        });

        describe('player lost', () => {
            const rendered = shallow(<App gameOver={true} playerWon={false} />);
            it('gives <GameOverMessage<mark>Container</mark> /> correct prop', () => {
                expect(rendered.find('<mark>Connect(GameOverMessage)</mark>')).to.have.prop('win', false);
            });
        });
    });
});
```

To finish up, we just need to change the component that is rendered in our `App` component:

<div class="fp">app/components/app.js</div>
```jsx
// ...
import { GameOverMessage<mark>Container</mark> } from './game_over_message';

export class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        let messageComponent;
        if(this.props.gameOver) {
            messageComponent = <GameOverMessage<mark>Container</mark> win={this.props.playerWon} />;
        }
        // ...
    }
}
// ..
```

One problem that still needs to be fixed: the player can draw cards even if the game is over. Let's prevent this by disabling the "Hit" and "Stand" buttons.

Before we figure out how to implement this behavior, let's write a test for it.

We already disable the buttons when `hasStood` is true, and now we want to do the same thing when `gameOver` is true. We already have a test for `hasStood`, and this test will look very similar. Try writing the test yourself before looking at our code below.

Your test should fail and give you output that looks like:

```
AssertionError: expected the node in <Info /> to have a 'disabled' attribute

HTML:

<button>Hit</button>
```

Here is our test:

<div class="fp">test/components/info_spec.js</div>
```jsx
// ...

describe('<Info />', () => {
    // ...

    describe('when gameOver is true', () => {
        const rendered = shallow(<Info gameOver={true} />);

        it('disables hit and stand buttons', () => {
            const buttons = rendered.find('button');
            buttons.forEach((b) => {
                expect(b).to.have.attr('disabled');
            });
        });
    });
});
```

To make our `Info` component code more DRY and the render function less complicated, let's calculate whether the buttons should be disabled before the return statement:

<div class="fp">app/components/info.jsx</div>
```jsx{5-8}
// ...

export class Info extends React.Component {
    render() {
        let disableButtons = false;
        if(this.props.hasStood || this.props.gameOver) {
            disableButtons = true;
        }
        return (
            <div id="info">
                <span id="player_record">
                    Wins: {this.props.winCount} Losses: {this.props.lossCount}
                </span>
                <span id="buttons">
                    <button disabled={<mark>disableButtons</mark>}
                            onClick={this.props.onClickHit}>
                        Hit
                    </button>
                    <button disabled={<mark>disableButtons</mark>}
                            onClick={this.props.onClickStand}>
                        Stand
                    </button>
                </span>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Now we need to add `gameOver` to `mapDispatchToProps()` so that we get `gameOver` from the store:

<div class="fp">app/components/info.js</div>
```js{8}
// ...

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
    return {
        winCount: state.get('winCount'),
        lossCount: state.get('lossCount'),
        hasStood: state.get('hasStood')<mark>,</mark>
        gameOver: state.get('gameOver')
    };
};

// ...
```

### Blackjack!

It's also possible for the user to get 21 on their initial deal by getting an ace and a card worth 10 points.

We should account for this possibility in the `SETUP_GAME` action's reducer function.

We won't be able to use on the trick of stacking the deck to control which cards are dealt for these tests because `SETUP_GAME` creates a whole new deck. This means that we will have to overwrite ("stub") the deal method.

To do this, we are going to use a new package called Proxyquire. Let's first install Proxyquire:

```
npm install --save-dev proxyquire
```

Proxyquire allows us to require another file and replace the things that that file requires with stubs (or anything we want). In this case, we are going to run our tests on a special version of the reducer that uses a stubbed `score` function -- one that thinks the score of any hand is 21. The reducer gets its `score` function from `./lib/cards`, so we want to use Proxyquire to replace the `score` function in that file with our special function.

Proxyquire provides us with a function, `proxyquire()`, that takes two arguments: the file that we are importing from and an object with keys that tell it which modules we want to replace (these should line up with the `from "..."` lines in the file we're requiring). The values of the object in the second parameter are more objects that have keys that are the names of the functions (or classes or anything else that is exported) that we want to replace and the values are their replacements. If something that we import isn't overridden, it will just use the original "thing" (function, class, etc.). Here's an example to make it more concrete:

```js
const action = setupGame();
const initialState = undefined;

const cardUtils = { }; // we'll put the overrides in here

/* require reducer.js but override the functions
   imported from './lib/cards' with the functions
   in cardUtils (if there are any).
   we have the .default at the end because the reducer
   function is the default export from the reducer.js
   file */
const stubbedReducer = proxyquire(
    '../app/reducer.js',
    {'./lib/cards': cardUtils}
).default;

/* this is the function we want to replace deal with
   proxyquire will tell the reducer to use this function
   instead of the usual deal function because we put it
   in cardUtils. We'll just return an empty List for the
   deck and an ace and a jack for the cards dealt */
cardUtils.score = () => 21;


const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

/* now every time we try to calculate the score
   in the stubbedReducer we will calculate the
   score to be 21 */
```

In this case, we just wrote our own override function for `score()`, but we also could have used a Sinon stub if we wanted something more flexible. We'll see how to do this in a bit.

Let's add this to our reducer test:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js{2}
// ...
import proxyquire from 'proxyquire';

import reducer from '../app/reducer';

describe('reducer', () => {
    describe("SETUP_GAME", () => {
        const action = setupGame();

        // ...

        describe("when dealt winning hand", () => {
            const cardUtils = { };
            const stubbedReducer = proxyquire('../app/reducer.js', {'./lib/cards': cardUtils}).default;
            cardUtils.score = () => 21;

            const initialState = undefined;
            const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

            it('sets gameOver and playerWon', () => {
                expect(nextState.get('gameOver')).to.eq(true);
                expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(true);
            });
        });
    });

    // ...
});
```

Now the code for reducer to make this test pass:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js{7-10}
const setupGame = (currentState, seed) => {
    // ...

    <mark>let</mark> gameOver = false;
    <mark>let</mark> playerWon = undefined;

    if(score(playerHand) == 21) {
        gameOver = true;
        playerWon = true;
    }

    const newState = new Map({
        deck, playerHand,
        dealerHand, hasStood,
        gameOver, playerWon
    });

    return currentState.merge(newState);
};
```

We'll also want to increase the winCount. Here's the test:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js
// ...

describe('reducer', () => {
    describe("SETUP_GAME", () => {
        // ...

        describe("when dealt winning hand", () => {
            // ...

            it('increments winCount', () => {
                expect(nextState.get('winCount')).to.eq(1);
            });
        });
    });
});
```

We will also want to change the tests we had previously written for `SETUP_GAME` so that they don't fail randomly when the player is dealt blackjack. To do this, we can use Proxyquire again to control how we calculate the score for the other tests that are written assuming the player isn't dealt blackjack.

Here's what all the `SETUP_GAME` reducer tests look like after making these changes:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js
// ...

describe('reducer', () => {
    describe("SETUP_GAME", () => {
        const action = setupGame();
        const cardUtils = { };
        const stubbedReducer = proxyquire('../app/reducer.js', {'./lib/cards': cardUtils}).default;

        describe("when not dealt winning hand", () => {
            cardUtils.score = () => 10;

            describe("with empty initial state", () => {
                const initialState = undefined;
                const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

                it('sets up deck', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('deck').size).to.eq(49);
                });

                it('sets up playerHand', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('playerHand').size).to.eq(2);
                });

                it('sets up dealerHand', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('dealerHand').size).to.eq(2);
                    expect(nextState.get('dealerHand').last()).to.eq(new Map());
                });

                it('sets up hasStood', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('hasStood')).to.eq(false);
                });

                it('sets up gameOver', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('gameOver')).to.eq(false);
                });

                it('sets up playerWon', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(undefined);
                });
            });

            describe("with existing initial state", () => {
                const initialState = new Map({'winCount': 10, 'lossCount': 7, 'deck': 'fake deck'});
                const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

                it('adds new variables', () => {
                    expect(Array.from(nextState.keys())).to.include(
                        'deck', 'playerHand', 'dealerHand',
                        'hasStood', 'gameOver', 'playerWon'
                    );
                });

                it('keeps old variables', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('winCount')).to.eq(10);
                    expect(nextState.get('lossCount')).to.eq(7);
                });

                it('overwrites old variables', () => {
                    expect(nextState.get('deck')).not.to.eq('fake deck');
                });
            });
        });

        // ...
});
```

To get the new tests for when the player is dealt a winning hand to pass, the reducer code is a little trickier. It's possible to dispatch `SETUP_GAME` before `winCount` has been set. Therefore we need to initialize `winCount` to 0 before incrementing it. We can use an `||` operator as a shortcut. We will use a line that looks like this:

```js
let winCount = currentState.get('winCount') || 0;
```

This is saying set `winCount` equal to `currentState.get('winCount')` unless `currentState.get('winCount')` is `undefined` (or `false`). If it's `undefined`, set it to 0.

Here is the code for the reducer:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js{7,12}
// ...
const setupGame = (currentState, seed) => {
    // ...

    let gameOver = false;
    let playerWon = undefined;
    let winCount = currentState.get('winCount') || 0;

    if(score(playerHand) == 21) {
        gameOver = true;
        playerWon = true;
        winCount += 1;
    }

    const newState = new Map({
        deck, playerHand,
        dealerHand, hasStood,
        gameOver, playerWon<mark>,</mark>
        <mark>winCount</mark>
    });

    return currentState.merge(newState);
};
// ...
```

If you want to test it in the browser, keep playing games until you're dealt blackjack. You can also dispatch a `SETUP_GAME` event with the seed `1463783318510` in the Redux DevTools (don't ask me how long it took to get that!).

#### Debugging

Imagine you just deployed this code to production and you go home for the day. At 3AM, you get a call from your boss saying "I keep getting user error reports! Fix the problem!!" You log into the support email system and see hundreds of people with claims like this:

```
I loaded your page and I got an ace and king.

The page said I won, but my win count didn't go up!!!!

Fix this or I'll sue you!
```

One user helpfully submitted a screenshot of the error:

![bug_report](/img/react_blackjack/error_report.png)

What went wrong? See if you can figure out what the problem is before reading on.

Hint: The problem has to do with the way we set up the game. Walk through the code in `index.js` line by line and see if you can identify the problem. Keep track of the state object while you so.

Here's the answer:

In `index.js`, we create the store passing `undefined` as the parameter. Then, we dispatch a `SETUP_GAME` action. This action will deal the cards to the player and dealer and then check if the player was dealt a winning hand. If the player does win immediately, `winCount` is incremented or set to one if it was previously undefined (which is the case here). Everything good so far.

After dispatching `SETUP_GAME`, we dispatch `SET_RECORD` with 0 wins and 0 losses. This is where the problem is, as this will set the record to 0 no matter what the previous record was. So if the player is dealt a winning hand, the `SETUP_GAME` action correctly sets `winCount` to 1, but this is immediately set back to 0 by the next action.

There are a few ways to deal with this. We could have `SET_RECORD` only set `winCount` and `lossCount` if they are undefined in the current state. We could set up an initial state where `winCount` and `lossCount` are both set to 0 and pass this initial state to the store when we call `createStore()`. Or we could simply move the `SET_RECORD` action before the `SETUP_GAME` action.

Only setting `winCount` and `lossCount` if they are undefined, which makes this action pretty useless except when initializing the state. At this point, we might as well get rid of the `SET_RECORD` action and just set up the initial state and pass it to `createStore()` without bothering with actions.

Initializing `winCount` and `lossCount` without an action and passing it to `createStore()` as the initial state is perfectly valid and would be the best approach at this point in the application. However, in the next part of this guide, we are going to let users save their records to a server and load them from a server as well. The easiest way to do that will be to change the `SET_RECORD` action to get a record from the server rather than just setting the record to 0-0, so we will still want to dispatch `SET_RECORD` at the beginning of the application.

For now, let's fix this bug by changing the order that we dispatch actions. We'll set the initial record and then deal the first hand and add one to `winCount` if ncecessary:

<div class="fp">app/index.js</div>
```js{5-6}
// ...

let store = createStore(reducer, undefined, window.devToolsExtension ? window.devToolsExtension() : undefined);

store.dispatch(setRecord(0, 0));
store.dispatch(setupGame());

// ...
```

### Standing

The final part of the game that we need to implement is the option to "stand". In blackjack, the player can choose to stop drawing cards and let the dealer draw. This is referred to as "standing."

Once the player chooses to stand, the dealer starts to draw. The dealer will take cards from the deck until the score of the cards in the dealer's hand is greater than or equal to 17.

After the dealer stops taking cards, the player wins if the dealer's score is higher than 21. If both the player and the dealer have scores lower than 21, the player wins if the score of the player's hand is greater than the score of the dealer's hand. The player loses if the player's hand has a lower score than the score of the dealer's hand. If both have the same score, it is a tie and the player neither wins nor loses.

Let's start with some tests for the dealer drawing. We'll use Proxyquire again to control which cards are drawn so that we can test different scenarios. In this case, we'll be using Sinon stubs to give us more control over the methods and to allow us to spy on methods to verify that they were actually called.

Since we'll be using different options on the stubs, we're going to use a new Mocha feature called `beforeEach()`. `beforeEach()` is a function that takes a function as a parameter. Before each of the `it` tests, Mocha will call the function passed to `beforeEach()`. In this case, we will use `beforeEach()` to reset the stubs so that each test will be independent of the others.

We already have a test for the `STAND` action to check that it sets `hasStood` to true. We are going to keep this test, but modify it so that it uses a stubbed `score()` as well. For that part, we don't care about the dealer drawing cards -- we can prevent this from happening by having `score()` return 21 each time it's called. This will make the `hasStood` test more independent of the rest of the tests -- if something goes wrong with the dealer drawing cards, this test won't know about it.

Here are first set of tests for `STAND`:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js{2}
// ...
import sinon from 'sinon';

import reducer from '../app/reducer';

describe('reducer', () => {
    describe("STAND", () => {
        const action = stand();

        const cardUtils = { };
        const stubbedReducer = proxyquire('../app/reducer.js', {'./lib/cards': cardUtils}).default;

        const initialState = new Map({
            hasStood: false,
            dealerHand: new List(),
            winCount: 0,
            lossCount: 0
        });

        it('sets hasStood to true', () => {

            cardUtils.score = sinon.stub();
            cardUtils.score.returns(21);

            const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

            expect(nextState.get('hasStood')).to.eq(true);
        });

        describe('dealer drawing', () => {

            beforeEach( () => {
                cardUtils.score = sinon.stub();
                cardUtils.deal = sinon.stub();
                cardUtils.deal.returns([new List(), new List()]);
            });

            it('does not draw when total is > 17', () => {
                cardUtils.score.returns(18);

                stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

                expect(cardUtils.deal.called).to.eq(false);
            });

            it('stops drawing when total is 17', () => {
                cardUtils.score.onCall(0).returns(10);
                cardUtils.score.onCall(1).returns(17);

                stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

                expect(cardUtils.deal.calledOnce).to.eq(true);
            });
        });
    });
});
```

Reading the "does not draw when total is > 17" test in English: Make the score function always return 18. Dispatch the action. Expect that we never called the deal function.

Reading the "stops drawing when the total is 17" in English: Make the score function return 10 the first time it's called. Make the score function return 17 the second time it's called. Dispatch the action. Expect that we called the `deal` function once.

These are more proper "unit" tests of the reducer function. When we wrote tests earlier, we controlled which cards would be dealt during the test by changing the deck object in the state. Those tests would fail if there was a problem with the `deal` helper function. If we changed the way the `deal` function worked, we might have to re-write those tests.

In this case, however, the test for the reducer does not rely on any of the helper functions in `cards.js`. These methods could have bugs or even be removed from the file, but our tests would still pass as long as the reducer function is implemented correctly.

A good testing suite will have a lot of unit tests and a few "end to end" or "integration" tests. The unit tests will be responsible for testing a very small specific part of the code as independently from the rest of the program as possible. The end to end tests will make sure that the entire code base is working together properly.

Before we get our test to pass, we will have to change one more thing. Since our `STAND` action handler is now going to use `deal()`, it needs to have a seed.

To add the seed, we can change our action creator:

<div class="fp">app/action_creators.js</div>
```js
// ...

export function stand(seed=new Date().getTime()) {
    return { "type": "STAND", seed };
}
```

And our main reducer `switch`:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js
export default function(currentState=new Map(), action) {
    switch(action.type) {
        // ...
        case 'STAND':
            return stand(currentState<mark>, action.seed</mark>);
    }
    return currentState;
}
```

Now we're ready to add the code to deal to the dealer:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js
// ...

const stand = (currentState<mark>, seed</mark>) => {
    let newState = new Map({"hasStood": true});

    let dealerHand = currentState.get('dealerHand');
    let deck = currentState.get('deck');

    while(score(dealerHand) < 17) {
        let newCards;
        [deck, newCards] = deal(deck, 1, 1);
        dealerHand = dealerHand.push(newCards.get(0));
    }

    newState = newState.merge({dealerHand, deck});

    return currentState.merge(newState);
};

// ...
```

Right now if you try to hit stand in the browser, you won't see new cards added to the dealer's hand. This is because of the dummy card we added to the hand. Right now, the score method will return `NaN` if one of the cards passed to it does not have a rank (which the dummy card doesn't). Let's remove the dummy card in the `STAND` action. First the test:

<div class="fp">test/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js
// ...

describe('reducer', () => {
    // ...

    describe("STAND", () => {
        // ...

        it('removes dummy card', () => {
            const initialState = fromJS({
                dealerHand: [{ suit: 'S', rank: 'K' }, {}]
            });

            cardUtils.score = sinon.stub();
            cardUtils.score.returns(21);

            const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

            expect(nextState.get('dealerHand').size).to.eq(1);
        });

        // ...
    });
});
```

For the code to remove the dummy card, we could just remove the last card from the dealerHand `List`. However, we'll write code that is a little more general in case things change at a later time:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js{5}
const stand = (currentState, seed) => {
    // ...
    let deck = currentState.get('deck');

    dealerHand = dealerHand.filter((element) => element != new Map());

    while(score(dealerHand) < 17) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
};
```

Now try hitting "stand" in the browser. You should see the dealer get some cards.

The last step is to decide who the winner is. We want to test four cases: the player has a higher score than the dealer, the dealer has a higher score than the player and the dealer's score is 21 or lower, the dealer has a higher score than the player and the dealer's score is higher than 21, and the dealer and player have the same score. We'll keep using stubs to create the different scenarios we want to test.

<div class="fp">spec/reducer_spec.js</div>
```js
// ...

describe('reducer', () => {
    // ...

    describe("STAND", () => {
        // ...

        describe('determining winner', () => {
            beforeEach( () => {
                cardUtils.score = sinon.stub();
                cardUtils.deal = sinon.stub();
                cardUtils.deal.returns([new List(), new List()]);
            });

            it('increments win count and sets playerWon if player wins', () => {
                cardUtils.score.onCall(0).returns(17); // dealer drawing check
                cardUtils.score.onCall(1).returns(20); // user score
                cardUtils.score.onCall(2).returns(17); // dealer score

                const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

                expect(nextState.get('winCount')).to.eq(initialState.get('winCount') + 1);
                expect(nextState.get('lossCount')).to.eq(initialState.get('lossCount'));
                expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(true);
            });

            it('increments win count and sets playerWon if dealer busts', () => {
                cardUtils.score.onCall(0).returns(17); // dealer drawing check
                cardUtils.score.onCall(1).returns(20); // user score
                cardUtils.score.onCall(2).returns(22); // dealer score

                const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

                expect(nextState.get('winCount')).to.eq(initialState.get('winCount') + 1);
                expect(nextState.get('lossCount')).to.eq(initialState.get('lossCount'));
                expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(true);
            });

            it('does not change counts if tie', () => {
                cardUtils.score.onCall(0).returns(17); // dealer drawing check
                cardUtils.score.onCall(1).returns(17); // user score
                cardUtils.score.onCall(2).returns(17); // dealer score

                const nextState = stubbedReducer(initialState, action);

                expect(nextState.get('winCount')).to.eq(initialState.get('winCount'));
                expect(nextState.get('lossCount')).to.eq(initialState.get('lossCount'));
                expect(nextState.get('playerWon')).to.eq(undefined);
            });

            it('increments loss count and sets playerWon if dealer wins', () => {
                /* Your code here */
            });
        });
    });
});
```

Now let's write the logic in the reducer to get the tests to pass:

<div class="fp">app/reducer.js</div>
```js
// ...

const stand = (currentState, seed) => {
    // ...

    let winCount = currentState.get('winCount');
    let lossCount = currentState.get('lossCount');
    const playerHand = currentState.get('playerHand');

    const playerScore = score(playerHand);
    const dealerScore = score(dealerHand);
    let playerWon = undefined;

    if(playerScore > dealerScore || dealerScore > 21) {
        /* Your code here! */
    } else if(dealerScore > playerScore) {
        /* Your code here! */
    }

    const gameOver = true;

    newState = newState.merge({dealerHand, deck, winCount, lossCount, gameOver, playerWon});

    return currentState.merge(newState);
};

// ...
```

Why do we still need `hasStood` if we are going to set `gameOver` to true any way? In the next part of this guide we will change our application so that the dealer draws cards one-by-one in which case we will still want to disable the "hit" and "stand" buttons after the player stands.

You should now be able to play blackjack in your browser with the app!

Feel free to build on top of this application to get more practice. You could:

- Add a counter for draws
- Simulate playing in a casino (use multiple decks and don't reset the deck between each game)
- Add options to bet and track winnings

In the final part of this guide we will use advanced Redux features to create forms, reveal dealer's cards one at a time, and persist win/loss records to a server!
